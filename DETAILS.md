# Frontend Speedrun Details

## The Challenge

Complete as many of the frontend projects listed in the [README](./README.md) as you can during the time allotted. Then, arrange your best work into a portfolio of your own design.

This is designed to be a one month challenge. However, you can select whichever timeframe best matches your goals and availability. There are no rules about which technology to use - you are free to choose your own adventure by electing to complete the projects with or without frameworks and libraries you'd like to prioritize practicing with. (Angular, React, Vue, Bootstrap, Tailwind, TypeScript, Sass, etc)


## Details

You can find the requirements for each of the challenges in the [challenge-specifications](./challenge-specifications/) directory. In each folder, you are provided with:

- an `index.html` file which may be used as a starting point
- an `images` folder which contains any images necessary for completing the project
- a design folder which contains screenshots for both mobile and desktop resolutions of the project you're creating
- a `style-guide.md` file which details design specifics you'll want to keep in mind while working through the project. It will list fonts used, font sizes, colors used, etc.

There is a starting `index.html` file in the `docs` folder. If you want to deploy your final portfolio which displays all the projects you coded during the challenge to github pages, you can use this html file as the entry point for your full portfolio, then add each new project as you complete them by placing a folder containing the project into `docs` and placing a link to the html for your project into `docs/index.html`
